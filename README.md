## My process

  I like to start with handmade wireframes. I choose to work with paper and ink because it gives me a very visual idea of what I got to do. I also like to write down the classes I'd like to use. Sometimes they change or I realize I need more. And that's a huge part of learning that when coding, there are a lot of things that are almost invisible to the eye. I like to take my time to get all the details and write them down. 

  I think my knowledge and all this years of working with graphic design and softwares such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Corel Draw had given me an amazingly sense of what needs to be done. As a neewbie, I tend to be very visual at first, and then, all the spaces and negative ones pop up to my eye and let me see them. I'm really greatfull with this new learnings and to have stepped inside this beatiful wordl of coding. I relly enjoy HTML & CSS.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Continued development

I-m so excited to keep on learning how to code this simple things. At first, I tried to code an entire website from scratch, and my head went nuts. I understand the theory, but it's not that easy to put it on practice just like that. Next, I'm going to keep on challenging myself with this quests from frontendmentor.io. -Great discovery, by the way.

## Acknowledgments

I'm really thankful with the team in Coder House, with my students fellows, with my tutor, and far away from wanting to sound selfish, I'm really proud of me because I've had a couple of years very hard. I'm happy that I choose this path and I know that, even it won't get any easier, the benefits and the feelings of overcoming are going to be a lot of times greater. I believe in that.

Thank you so much. 
Glad to exist right now.
